# What is C++
C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

# What is Linked List
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

# What is Double Linked List
A doubly linked list consists of two pointers that store the address of the next successive node and the address of the previous node. The traversal in a doubly linked list happens in both forward and backward directions.
In computer science, a doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. 
Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field.
